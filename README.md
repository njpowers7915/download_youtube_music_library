# Identify all songs in a YouTube Music playlist

This Python script allows you easily identify all songs contained in a YouTube Music playlist.
Once complete, I plan on converting this script to PHP to more easily provide a simple user interface
that will allows users to enter a playlist name or id and will return a list of songs that's easy to read through.

## Usage

1. Make sure the latest version of Python is installed on your local machine

2. Clone this repo to your local machine and run:

  $ python3 get_music.py
 
3. When prompted, enter the id of a YouTube channel for which you'd like to see a list of all songs or videos.
